I finally have a shiny new Jekyll based Github blog. <!--more-->:smile:

The theme I'm using is [Autm-rb](http://railsr.github.io/introducing-autm-rb/) and the image slider on the [homepage](http://schaazzz.github.io) is [JSSOR](http://www.jssor.com/). I'm using images directly from a [Flickr set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/schaazzz/sets/72157622960195643) which _I_ think contains the best pictures I've taken so far. Since the set in question contains quite a few pictures, manually retrieving the URLs for thumbnails and images would've been a tad tedious, so I wrote a script using [this Flickr API](http://stuvel.eu/media/flickrapi-docs/documentation/) to do this, you can find this script [here](https://github.com/schaazzz/script_magic/blob/master/get_photo_urls_from_flickr_set.py).

I'll cover how I integrated JSSOR into Jekyll/Autm-rb in another blog post.
